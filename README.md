A game I made in two weeks for the Pokitto handheld. Find it here: https://www.pokitto.com/

Instructions:
A: start game. Hold B to view instructions. Left: Music on, Right: Music off.

In-game, D-pad: move face pieces in the middle to top, right, bottom or left boxes. Button B uses a coin to buy a new center piece if the existing one doesnâ€™t fit anywhere. However, as a penalty, a random box will get cleared.

Enjoy!
