# pokittobloids
A game I made in two weeks for the Pokitto handheld. Find it here: https://www.pokitto.com/

Installation:
Download the zip file, exract the bin file to the root of your sd card, the copy the bloids folder to your sd card. File structure should be:

bloids/gameSong.wav
bloids/menuSong.wav
bloids.bin

Instructions:
A: start game. Hold B to view instructions. Left: Music on, Right: Music off.

In-game, D-pad: move face pieces in the middle to top, right, bottom or left boxes. Button B uses a coin to buy a new center piece if the existing one doesnâ€™t fit anywhere. However, as a penalty, a random box will get cleared.

Enjoy!
